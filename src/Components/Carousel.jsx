      " FiTech has been an incredible experience for me so far. It's more than just a communityâ€”it's a solid support system for young developers like me who are stepping into the tech world. Currently, I'm part of their ongoing cohort on front-end development, and it's been nothing short of amazing. The program is well-structured, with experienced mentors guiding us every step of the way. They've made learning JavaScript feel so achievable, The mentorship and hands-on approach have been games changers for my learning journey",
